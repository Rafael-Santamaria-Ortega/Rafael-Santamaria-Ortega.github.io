**Ransomware Attack Response Playbook**

**Purpose:**

This playbook provides guidelines for an effective response to ransomware attacks, aimed at minimizing damage, facilitating recovery, and preventing future incidents.

**Scope:**

The procedures apply to all organizational units impacted by ransomware, detailing steps from initial detection to recovery and post-incident analysis.

**Team Roles and Responsibilities:**

- **Incident Response Manager:** Leads the response efforts, ensuring coordination across teams.
- **Security Analysts:** Conduct initial investigations, malware analysis, and assist in containment and eradication.
- **IT Support:** Manage system isolation, data restoration, and ensure continuity of IT operations.
- **Communications Officer:** Responsible for internal and external communications regarding the incident.
- **Legal/Compliance Officer:** Address legal and compliance issues, including data breach notifications and interaction with law enforcement.

**Phase 1: Identification**

- **Detection Tools:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, antivirus programs, and network monitoring to identify signs of a ransomware infection.
- **Alert System:** Implement automated alerts for suspected ransomware activity to ensure rapid response.
- **Employee Reporting:** Encourage employees to report suspicious activity or inaccessible files immediately.

**Phase 2: Containment**

- **Network Isolation:** Disconnect infected systems from the network to prevent the spread of ransomware.
- **Account Disablement:** Temporarily disable affected user accounts to limit access to network resources.
- **Traffic Segmentation:** Use firewall rules and segmentation to isolate network segments impacted by the attack.

**Phase 3: Eradication**

- **Malware Removal:** Employ specialized tools to remove ransomware from infected systems. Confirm the removal with multiple scans.
- **System Cleanse:** Wipe and reformat hard drives where the ransomware was active to eliminate any traces of the malware.

**Phase 4: Recovery**

- **Data Restoration:** Restore data from backups that are confirmed to be free of ransomware. Test restored data to ensure it is intact and malware-free.
- **System Reintegration:** Gradually reintegrate cleaned systems into the network, monitoring for signs of lingering issues.
- **Continuity Measures:** Implement interim solutions to maintain business operations during the recovery phase.

**Phase 5: Post-Incident**

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate how the ransomware entered the network, and identify any security weaknesses that were exploited.
- **Lessons Learned:** Hold a debriefing session to gather insights from the incident, documenting outcomes and recommendations for strengthening security.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant regulations by reporting the incident to necessary authorities and affected parties if required.
- **Awareness Training:** Enhance ransomware awareness and training programs to educate employees about preventive measures and the importance of security hygiene.

**Tools and Resources Needed:**

- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools
- Antivirus and anti-malware software
- Network security appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Data backup and recovery solutions
- Secure communication platforms for incident management
