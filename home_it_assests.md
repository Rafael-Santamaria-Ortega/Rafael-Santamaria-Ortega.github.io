# Home Office Network Device Inventory | Assest Management

In this hands-on activity from the `Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate`, I simulated managing a `home office network` for a small business by creating an inventory of connected devices. The task involved identifying key networked devices, such as computers, smart home devices, and storage systems, listing each deviceâ€™s important characteristics, and assigning a sensitivity level based on its need for protection. This inventory helps in identifying sensitive assets that require enhanced security measures. 

The inventory is the following: 

| **Asset**            | **Network Access** | **Owner**         | **Location**         | **Notes**                                                                             | **Sensitivity**    |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Network router       | Continuous         | ISP               | On-premises          | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices on the home network use 5 GHz.        | Confidential        |
| Desktop              | Occasional         | Homeowner         | On-premises          | Contains private information, like photos.                                            | Restricted          |
| Guest smartphone     | Occasional         | Friend            | On and Off-premises  | Connects to the home network.                                                         | Internal-only       |
| Personal smartphone  | Occasional         | Homeowner         | On and off-premises  | Connects to the home network and contains sensitive information.                      | Internal-only       |
| Smart printer        | Occasional         | Homeowner         | On-premises          | Bluetooth and WiFi-enabled device.                                                    | Internal-only       |
| Bluetooth headphones | Occasional         | Homeowner         | On and off-premises  | Bluetooth device.                                                                     | Confidential        |

## NOTES: The sensitivity categories concern the principle of least privilege

| **Categories**     | **Access Designation**           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Restricted         | Need-to-know                     |
| Confidential       | Limited to specific users        |
| Internal-only      | Users on-premises                |
| Public             | Anyone                           |
