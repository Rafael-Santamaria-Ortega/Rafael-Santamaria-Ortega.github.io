# Home Office Network Device Inventory | Assest Management

In this exercise from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I simulated managing a home office network for a small business by creating an inventory of connected devices. The task involved identifying key networked devices, such as computers, smart home devices, and storage systems, listing each deviceâ€™s important characteristics, and assigning a sensitivity level based on its need for protection. This inventory helps in identifying sensitive assets that require enhanced security measures.
