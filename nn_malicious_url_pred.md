## Neural Network for Malicious Url Predicting (In development) | Python, TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Data Engineering

This neural network, built and trained from scratch using TensorFlow, predicts whether URLs gathered from the wild are malicious or benign. The model was initially trained on Kaggle's Malicious URL Dataset, and I'm currently working on enhancing its capabilities by incorporating learning rate decay, an F1 score to better asses metrics, and my own collected data. Thus, I must state that this project is still in development, but I would say it is about 80% completed. 

The idea behind this project stems from the growing sophistication of phishing attacks and malicious websites, aswell as from our usually bad human performance when faced with social engineering. Also, traditional blacklist approaches often fail to detect new or modified malicious URLs, creating a need for more dynamic, intelligent detection methods. If not, it's going to be an endless game of cat and mouse. 

As far as results, the model has demonstrated acceptable performance metrics on the test set, indicates strong real-world applicability. Indeed, this neural network could serve as a valuable component in a company's security infrastructure, particularly for real-time threat detection and prevention. After all, in cybersecurity:

"Prevention is better than cure."

However, this kind of apps already exists, so I'm not claiming to reinvent the wheel as the saying goes. The primary objective here is to demonstrate a way to leverage machine learning to engineer more robust, adaptive cybersecurity solutions.
