## Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

This algorithm designed for automating basic malware scans in WIndows Operating Systems reads a list of known malware names (specifically '.exe' files) from a '.csv' file, compiles these into a malware signature list, and scans the local computerâ€™s file system for matching '.exe' files. Any matches are flagged as potential threats and logged in an output '.txt' file. To run the algorithm in devices that do not have Python installed, I created an '.exe' file using PyInstaller that is also stored at it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rafael-Santamaria-Ortega/Malware_Detection_Algorithm).

I am aware that this is a very basic algorithm with 3 main shortcomings: 

1. The unreliability of using file names to detect malware. Furthermore, not every malware is a '.exe' file, as even fileless malware exists. 

2. The amount of false positives derived from '.exe' malicious files trying to masquarade as legitimate files.

3. The lack of independance from the '.csv' database.

In the future I plan to address each point by either transforming this simple Python code into a Deep Learning model that can "learn" to identify more malware characteristics to predict very accurately if the scanned files of all types are possible malware; even if there is no database present, as the model would already trained and ready to deploy. 

Anyway, here is a break down of the main code: 

### 1. Imports and Intialization:

* The csv Python module is imported to read the .csv database of malware names.
* Two empty data structures are initialized: 'convlist': A list to temporarily store .exe file names found in the .csv file; 'unique_exes:' A set to ensure only unique .exe names are kept.

```python
import csv

convlist = list()
unique_exes = set()
```

### 2. CSV Parsing and Malware Extraction:

* Opens and reads 'full.csv', where each row contains potential file paths or names;
* Checks each row to see if it contains an '.exe' file. If so, extracts the '.exe' filename and appends it to 'convlist';
* After reading all rows, iterates through 'convlist', extracts the last section (the actual filename) after the last double quote ("), and adds it to 'unique_exes' to ensure all entries are unique.

```python
print('Reading and parsing .csv database...')

with open('full.csv', mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    csvfh = csv.DictReader(file, fieldnames=['F'])
    for row in csvfh:
        exe_position = row['F'].find('.exe')
        data = row['F'][:exe_position + 4]
        if exe_position == -1:
            continue
        else:
            convlist.append(data)
    
    for line in convlist:
        exe = line.rsplit('"', 1)[-1].strip()
        unique_exes.add(exe)
```

### 3. Writing Unique Malware Names to a Text File:

* Converts 'unique_exes' set to a list ('convlist2') and writes all entries to 'newlistmalware.txt', separated by commas.
* This file now contains the known malware names that will be used in the scanning phase.

```python
print('Threat names identified!')

print('Extracting them in a txt file...')

convlist2 = list(unique_exes)
with open('newlistmalware.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
    output_file.write(",".join(convlist2))

print('Results extracted to newlistmalware.txt')
```

### 4. Computer Scan for Executables:

* Sets the scanning root directory as 'C:/' and uses 'os.walk' to iterate through all directories and files.
* Appends each '.exe' file found to 'exelist'. This list represents all executables on the local machine that will be compared with known malware.

```python
print('All done!')

import os

path = 'C:/'
pathfinder = os.fsencode(path)

print('Scanning computer...')

exelist = list()
for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path):
    for fname in filenames:
        if fname.endswith('.exe'):
            exelist.append(fname)
```

### 5. Threat Comparison:

* Reads 'newlistmalware.txt', which contains known malware names.
* For each executable in 'exelist', checks if it is mentioned in the known malware list ('newlistmalware.txt'). If it matches, it is added to 'threatlist'.

```python
print('Computer scan finished!')

print('Comparing results to known malware database...')

threatlist = set()
with open('newlistmalware.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    for line in file:
        for item in exelist:
            if item in line:
                threatlist.add(item)
                # count += 1
```

### 6. TThreat Count Display:

* Counts the number of unique matches (potential threats) in 'threatlist' and displays the count to the user.

```python
count = len(threatlist)
print('Possible threats found:', count)
```

### 7. Output of Results:

* Writes the total threat count and list of flagged executables to 'Possiblethreats.txt', creating a record of all identified threats.
* Signals completion to the user.

```python
print('Printing possible threats in a txt file!')

with open('Possiblethreats.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as lst:
    lst.write(f'Total possible threats:{count}\n')
    for exe in threatlist:
        lst.write(exe + '\n')
    # lst.write('\n'.join(threatlist))

print('Possible threats txt printed!')
print('All done!')
```

### 8. To investigate if they are actually safe and legitimate:

* Got to C:\ in your file explorer
* Type in the searchbar the name of the .exe file (It may take a bit)
* When found, check it's digital signature by right clicking them and searching for it in "properties". 

_If you see that there is no signature or that it has a strange name you should probably delete the file, BUT DO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS SINCE YOU CAN ACCIDENTALY DELETE ESSENTIAL PROGRAMS FORM YOUR DEVICE. SO, BEFORE DELETING ANYTHING, YOU SHOULD GOOGLE THE NAMES OF THE FILES AND SIGNATURES TO INVESTIGATE IF THEY ARE FROM MALICIOUS ACTORS OR NOT._

Also, due to the everchanging nature of digital threats, the database on that internet site is constantly being updated (aprox. once every hour), so the data might be a bit out of date. However, there is a way to update the database and get an updated scan:

1. Go to https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/
2. Export most recent .csv file
3. Put .csv file in the "materials" folder
4. Run the file "fullread.py" in that same folder to parse the database and extract the .exe files in the document, using the terminal form your device (assuming you have also downloaded Python in your computer)
5. It should produce or update a txt document with a list of the .exe threats identified in the .csv file inside that same folder
6. Copy or move the txt file to the folder "ScannerDownLoad"
7. Run the file "scannermalware" inside that folder using the terminal form your device
8. It should produce or update (if you have already run the scanner) a txt document called "Possiblethreats.txt" with the list of suspicious .exe programs

*IMPORTANT: This is not an "antivirus" and it doesn't replace their use or the use of a VPN or not taking the necessary precautions to secure your device!*
