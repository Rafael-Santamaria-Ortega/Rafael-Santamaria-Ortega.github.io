## Windows Malware Scanner

This was my first coding project, and is a basic file-based 'malware scanner'. The idea is to automate a very simple scanner for Windows Operating systems using Python. In short, the algorith reads a list of known malware names (specifically '.exe' files) from a '.csv' file, compiles these into a malware signature list, and scans the local computerâ€™s file system for matching '.exe' files. Any matches are flagged as potential threats and logged in an output '.txt' file. To run the algorithm in devices that do not have Python installed, I created an '.exe' file using PyInstaller that is also stored at it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rafael-Santamaria-Ortega/Malware_Detection_Algorithm).

I am aware that this is a very basic algorithm with many shortcomings, such as: 

1. The unreliability of using file names to detect malware. Furthermore, not every malware is a '.exe' file, as even fileless malware exists. 

2. The amount of false positives derived from '.exe' malicious files trying to masquarade as legitimate files.

3. The lack of independance from the '.csv' database.

In the future I plan to address each point by transforming this simple Python code into a Deep Learning model that can "learn" to identify more malware characteristics to predict very accurately if the scanned files are possible malware; even if there is no database present, as the model would already trained and ready to deploy.

Anyway, I will break down the main code: 

'''import csv

convlist = list()
unique_exes = set()'''

*Imports*: The csv Python module is imported to read the .csv database of malware names. 
*Initializations*: Two empty data structures are initialized: 
1.'convlist': A list to temporarily store .exe file names found in the .csv file.
2.'unique_exes:' A set to ensure only unique .exe names are kept.
