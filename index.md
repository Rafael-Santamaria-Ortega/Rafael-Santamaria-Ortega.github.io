This algorithm automates file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems.

[More details](./malware_scanner.md)

## Fraud Transaction Analyzer and Visualizer | Python, pandas, matplotlib, Data Analysis

This code suite loads and analyzes a dataset related to transaction data, identifying fraudulent activity patterns and visualizing key features.

[More details](./fraud_analyzer_visualizer.md)

## Cybersecurity Incident Response | Incident response, Threat analysis, Security engineering, Incident management

In this project I responded, analyzed, mitigated and performed a postmortem on a simulated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

[More details](./cyber_incident_response.md)

## Encryption with Python | Cryptography, Linux

In this project I encrypted basic data with asymmetric and symmetric Key Pairs using Python and the Linux Command Line in a hands-on lab. [certificate link](https://coursera.org/share/f57a28f19e8686c16574a15b9a4dc4fa)

## Web Scraping for Data Extraction | Python, urllib, BeatifulSoup

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to automate the extraction of data from web pages using urllib and BeautifulSoup. The script scrapes a specified number of links from a given URL and handles SSL certificate errors.

## JSON Data Retrieval and Aggregation | Python, urllib, json 

This Python algortithm fetches and parses JSON data from a web API. The script retrieves data from a specified URL, parses the JSON, extracts the 'comments' section, and sums up the aumount of comments.

## Identifying and Counting Email Frequency using Python | Python

This Python algorithm reads a file specified by the user and identifies the email address that appears the most times, using a dictionary to count occurrences of each email address and then determines the email with the highest count.

## Finding integers in email data using Regular Expressions | Python, RegEx

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to parse data for integers using regular expressions and counting said integers.
