# Featured Projects

### Neural Network for Malicious Url Predicting (In development) | Python, TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Data Engineering

* This project is a Neural Network built and trained from scratch using Kaggle's Malicious Url Dataset (working on improving it with my own data) and TensorFlow, to accurately predict if urls gathered from the wild are malicious or not. [(More details)](./nn_malicious_url_pred.md)

### Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

* This algorithm automates file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems. [(More details)](./malware_scanner.md)

### Fraud Transaction Analyzer and Visualizer | Python, pandas, matplotlib, Data Analysis

* This code suite loads and analyzes a dataset related to transaction data, identifying fraudulent activity patterns and visualizing key features. [(More details)](./fraud_analyzer_visualizer.html)

### Cybersecurity Incident Response | Incident response, Threat analysis and mitigation, Digital Forensics

* In this project I responded, analyzed, mitigated and performed a postmortem on a simulated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. [(More details)](./cyber_incident_response.md)

### Man in the Middle Malware Executable | Python, Penetration testing

* This Python script performs a dumpster diving 'Man in the Middle Attack' by exfiltrating all data from a Windows Recycle Bin, even if the compromised device does not have Python installed. [(More details)](./dumpster_diving.md)

### Encryption with Python | Cryptography, Linux

* In this project I encrypted basic data with asymmetric and symmetric Key Pairs using Python and the Linux Command Line. [(More details)](./encrypt_python.md)
