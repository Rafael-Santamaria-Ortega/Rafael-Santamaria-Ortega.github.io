# Projects:

## Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

This was my first coding project, and the motivating idea was to automate file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems. In short, the algorithm reads a database of known malware names from a '.csv' file, compiles these into a malware signature list, and scans the local computerâ€™s file system for matches. If any are found they get flagged as potential threats, and logged in an output text file for further analysis.
