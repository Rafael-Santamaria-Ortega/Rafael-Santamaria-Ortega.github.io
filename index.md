# Projects:

## Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

The motivating idea of this project was to automate file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems. In short, the algorithm reads a database of known malware names from a '.csv' file, compiles these into a malware signature list, and scans the local computerâ€™s file system for matches. If any are found they get flagged as potential threats, and logged in an output text file for further analysis.

## Encryption with Python | Cryptography, Linux

In this project I encrypted basic data with asymmetric and symmetric Key Pairs using Python and the Linux Command Line in a hands-on lab.

## Web Scraping for Data Extraction | Python, urllib, BeatifulSoup

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to automate the extraction of data from web pages using urllib and BeautifulSoup. The script scrapes a specified number of links from a given URL and handles SSL certificate errors.

## JSON Data Retrieval and Aggregation | Python, urllib, json 

This Python algortithm fetches and parses JSON data from a web API. The script retrieves data from a specified URL, parses the JSON, extracts the 'comments' section, and sums up the aumount of comments.

## Identifying and Counting Email Frequency using Python | Python

This Python algorithm reads a file specified by the user and identifies the email address that appears the most times, using a dictionary to count occurrences of each email address and then determines the email with the highest count.

## Finding integers in email data using Regular Expressions | Python, RegEx

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to parse data for integers using regular expressions and counting said integers.
