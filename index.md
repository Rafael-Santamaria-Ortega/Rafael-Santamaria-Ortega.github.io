# Featured Projects:

## Neural Network for Malicious Url Predicting (In development) | 
### Python, TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Data Engineering

This project is a Neural Network built and trained from scratch using Kaggle's Malicious Url Dataset (working on improving it with my own data) and TensorFlow, to accurately predict if urls gathered from the wild are malicious or not. [More details](./nn_malicious_url_pred.md)

## Windows Malware Scanner | 
### Python, Windows, csv

This algorithm automates file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems. [More details](./malware_scanner.md)

## Fraud Transaction Analyzer and Visualizer | 
### Python, pandas, matplotlib, Data Analysis

This code suite loads and analyzes a dataset related to transaction data, identifying fraudulent activity patterns and visualizing key features. [More details](./fraud_analyzer_visualizer.md)

## Cybersecurity Incident Response | 
### Incident response, Threat analysis, Security engineering, Incident management

In this project I responded, analyzed, mitigated and performed a postmortem on a simulated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. [More details](./cyber_incident_response.md)

## Incident Handler's Journal | 
### Linux, Suricata, VirusTotal, Wireshark, tcpdump, Google Chronicle, Splunk, Documentation

This project documents incident handling using various cybersecurity tools in 5 different simulated cyber attacks. [More details](./incident_handler_journal.md)

## Man in the Middle Malware Executable | 
### Python, Penetration testing

This Python script performs a dumpster diving 'Man in the Middle Attack' by exfiltrating all data from a Windows Recycle Bin, even if the compromised device does not have Python installed. [More details](./dumpster_diving.md)

## Encryption with Python | 
### Cryptography, Linux

In this project I encrypted basic data with asymmetric and symmetric Key Pairs using Python and the Linux Command. [More Details](./encrypt_python)
