# Featured Projects:

## Neural Network for Malicious Url Predicting (In development) | Python, TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Data Engineering

This project is a Neural Network built and trained from scratch using Kaggle's Malicious Url Dataset (working on improving it with my own data) and TensorFlow, to accurately predict if urls gathered from the wild are malicious or not. [More details](./nn_malicious_url_pred.md)

## Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

This algorithm automates file-based malware scanning of Windows Operating Systems. [More details](./malware_scanner.md)

## Fraud Transaction Analyzer and Visualizer | Python, pandas, matplotlib, Data Analysis

This code suite loads and analyzes a dataset related to transaction data, identifying fraudulent activity patterns and visualizing key features. [More details](./fraud_analyzer_visualizer.md)

## Cybersecurity Incident Response | Incident response, Threat analysis, Security engineering, Incident management

In this project I responded, analyzed, mitigated and performed a postmortem on a simulated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. [More details](./cyber_incident_response.md)

## Incident Handler's Journal | Linux, Suricata, VirusTotal, Wireshark, tcpdump, Google Chronicle, Splunk, Documentation

This project documents incident handling using various cybersecurity tools in 5 different simulated cyber attacks. [More details](./incident_handler_journal.md)

## Encryption with Python | Cryptography, Linux

In this project I encrypted basic data with asymmetric and symmetric Key Pairs using Python and the Linux Command. [More Details](./encrypt_python)

## Dumpster diving with Python | Python, Penetration testing

This Python script performs a dumpster diving 'Man in the Middle Attack' by exfiltrating all data from a Windows Recycle Bin, even if the compromised device does not have Python installed. [More details](./dumpster_diving.md)

## Web Scraping for Data Extraction | Python, urllib, BeatifulSoup

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to automate the extraction of data from web pages using urllib and BeautifulSoup. The script scrapes a specified number of links from a given URL and handles SSL certificate errors.

## JSON Data Retrieval and Aggregation | Python, urllib, json 

This Python algortithm fetches and parses JSON data from a web API. The script retrieves data from a specified URL, parses the JSON, extracts the 'comments' section, and sums up the aumount of comments.

## Identifying and Counting Email Frequency using Python | Python

This Python algorithm reads a file specified by the user and identifies the email address that appears the most times, using a dictionary to count occurrences of each email address and then determines the email with the highest count.

## Finding integers in email data using Regular Expressions | Python, RegEx

In this project I scripted a Python algorithm to parse data for integers using regular expressions and counting said integers.
