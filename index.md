# Highlighted Projects

### Neural Network for Malicious Url Predicting | Python, TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Data Engineering

* This project is a `Neural Network` built and trained from scratch using `Kaggle's Malicious Url Dataset` (working on improving it with my own data) and `TensorFlow`, to accurately predict if `urls` gathered from the wild are malicious or not. [(More details)](./nn_malicious_url_pred.html)

### Cybersecurity Incident Response | Incident response, Threat analysis and mitigation, Digital Forensics

* In this project I responded, analyzed, mitigated and performed a postmortem on a simulated `distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack`. [(More details)](./cyber_incident_response.html)

### Windows Malware Scanner | Python, Windows, csv

* This algorithm automates file-based malware scanning of `Windows Operating Systems`. [(More details)](./malware_scanner.html)

### Incident Handler's Journal | Linux Bash Shell, Wireshark, tcpdump, Suricata, Splunk, Chronicle, Ticketing Systems, VirusTotal, Social Engineering

* In this exercise from the `Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate`, I document the details of various security incidents and how I handled them using technical tools in hands-on labs. [(More details)](./incident_handler_journal.html)

### Encryption with Python | Cryptography, Linux

* In this project I encrypted basic data with `asymmetric Key Pairs` using `Python` and the `Linux Command Line`. [(More details)](./encrypt_python.html)
