# Control and Compliance Checklist for a Fictional Toy Company | GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) 

In this exercise from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I simulated being an IT auditor for a small U.S. toy company, Botium Toys, which is expanding its online presence. The scenario involved reviewing the company’s cybersecurity framework to support its growing international market. My goal was to assess the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment for an internal audit, focused on identifying risks, ensuring compliance (particularly with online payment and E.U. regulations), and recommending steps to strengthen the company’s security posture.
