# Machine Learning Model for Spam Detectiom | Python, Security Automatiom

This project is one of the hands-on tasks from J.P. Morgan & Chase Co. `Cybersecurity Virtual Internship` program, and it's goal was to code and train a `Machine Learning` Algorithm to `detect if an email is likely a spam/phishing attack or legitimate mail`. The training data was the enron dataset, and the process was the following. 

### Step 0 

* Unzip the dataset

### Step 1 

* Parse and format the dataset in a way that the model could be trained on. This implied using a Pandas dataframe, however the code was already provided in the excersise. So, what I did was comment it:

```python
import pandas as pd   #Import the relevant libraries; i.e. pandas to handle data, and os to find the path to the data
import os

def read_spam():    # Defining a function to read the dataset spam data 
    category = 'spam'    # Define variable called 'category'
    directory = './enron1/spam'    # Define a variable called 'directory' with the location of the data
    return read_category(category, directory)    # Call the function read_category()

def read_ham():    # Defining a function to read the 'ham' or data labeled as not spam
    category = 'ham' # Define variable called 'ham'
    directory = './enron1/ham'    # Define variable called 'directory' with the location of the data to be read
    return read_category(category, directory)    # Call the function read_category()

def read_category(category, directory):    # Defining a function to read the labeled data
    emails = []    # Create empty list to store the email from training data
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):    # Loop through each email stored as a separate .txt file
        if not filename.endswith(".txt"):    # Ignore files that are not .txt
            continue
        with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as fp:    # Open the location of each file as fp
            try:     # Error handling with try and except
                content = fp.read()    # Read each fp and store the data in the variable 'content'
                emails.append({'name': filename, 'content': content, 'category': category})    # Appedn the data to list as a dictionary with try entries 
            except:
                print(f'skipped {filename}')    # If error just skip the file
    return emails    # Return the list of emails

ham = read_ham()    # Define a variable to store all the data labeled as 'ham'
spam = read_spam()    # Define a variable to store all the data labeled as 'spam'

df_ham=pd.DataFrame.from_records(ham)    # Transform the 'ham' data into a panda dataframe so as to be able to train the model with clean data
df_spam=pd.DataFrame.from_records(spam)    # Transform the 'spam' data into a panda dataframe so as to be able to train the model with clean data
df=pd.concat([df_ham, df_spam], ignore_index=True)    # Use pandas.concat to join dataframes along an axis. In this case along the label axis
```

### Step 2 

* Now, the data had to be cleansed or preprocessed before passing it to the model. In ooder to do that I had to define a function that takes a string and replaces non alphabet characterss with a space, and also lowercases the result:

```python
import re    #Import the regular expressions library to handle any data 

def preprocessor(e):    # Define the preprocessor function 
    x=re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]',' ',e)    # Define a variable x that stores the result of calling the re.sub() function to substitute non alpha characters with sp√°ces
    e_reg=x.lower()    # Call .lower() on the variable x to lowercase the string
    return e_reg    # retirn the string preprocessed
```

### Step 3

* This is the step where I had to train the `Machine learning` model, based on some hints in the code. The code I wrote is the following:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# The CountVectorizer converts a text sample into a vector (think of it as an array of floats).
# Each entry in the vector corresponds to a single word and the value is the number of times the word appeared.
# Instantiate a CountVectorizer. Make sure to include the preprocessor you previously wrote in the constructor.
vectorizer=CountVectorizer(preprocessor=preprocessor,analyzer='word')
y=df['category'].map({'spam':1,'ham':0})

# Use train_test_split to split the dataset into a train dataset and a test dataset.
# The machine learning model learns from the train dataset.
# Then the trained model is tested on the test dataset to see if it actually learned anything.
# If it just memorized for example, then it would have a low accuracy on the test dataset and a high accuracy on the train dataset.
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(df['content'],y,test_size=0.2,train_size=0.8,shuffle=True,random_state=42)


# Use the vectorizer to transform the existing dataset into a form in which the model can learn from.
# Remember that simple machine learning models operate on numbers, which the CountVectorizer conveniently helped us do.
X_train_trans=vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_trans=vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Use the LogisticRegression model to fit to the train dataset.
# You may remember y = mx + b and Linear Regression from high school. Here, we fitted a scatter plot to a line.
# Logistic Regression is another form of regression. 
# However, Logistic Regression helps us determine if a point should be in category A or B, which is a perfect fit.
l_r=LogisticRegression()
l_r.fit(X_train_trans,y_train)

# Validate that the model has learned something.
# Recall the model operates on vectors. First transform the test set using the vectorizer. 
# Then generate the predictions.
y_pred=l_r.predict(X_test_trans)

# We now want to see how we have done. We will be using three functions.
# `accuracy_score` tells us how well we have done. 
# 90% means that every 9 of 10 entries from the test dataset were predicted accurately.
# The `confusion_matrix` is a 2x2 matrix that gives us more insight.
# The top left shows us how many ham emails were predicted to be ham (that's good!).
# The bottom right shows us how many spam emails were predicted to be spam (that's good!).
# The other two quadrants tell us the misclassifications.
# Finally, the `classification_report` gives us detailed statistics which you may have seen in a statistics class.
print("Accuracy:",accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred))
print("CM: ",confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test,y_pred))
```

* **The results were the following:**

```jupyter
Accuracy: 0.9748549323017408
CM:  [[717  12]
 [ 14 291]]
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.98      0.98      0.98       729
           1       0.96      0.95      0.96       305

    accuracy                           0.97      1034
   macro avg       0.97      0.97      0.97      1034
weighted avg       0.97      0.97      0.97      1034
```

* Overall the model did grat, as underscored by all metrics

### Step 4 

* Finally, I was tasked with visualizing the features created by the verctorization, and to output the top 10 features of emails labeled in each category. The code I wrote was the following:

```python
# Let's see which features (aka columns) the vectorizer created. 
# They should be all the words that were contained in the training dataset.
features=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# You may be wondering what a machine learning model is tangibly. It is just a collection of numbers. 
# You can access these numbers known as "coefficients" from the coef_ property of the model
# We will be looking at coef_[0] which represents the importance of each feature.
# What does importance mean in this context?
# Some words are more important than others for the model.
# It's nothing personal, just that spam emails tend to contain some words more frequently.
# This indicates to the model that having that word would make a new email more likely to be spam.
coef=l_r.coef_[0]
features_df=pd.DataFrame({'Feature':features,'Coef':coef})

# Iterate over importance and find the top 10 positive features with the largest magnitude.
# Similarly, find the top 10 negative features with the largest magnitude.
# Positive features correspond to spam. Negative features correspond to ham.
# You will see that `http` is the strongest feature that corresponds to spam emails. 
# It makes sense. Spam emails often want you to click on a link.
sorted_coef=features_df.sort_values(by='Coef',ascending=False)
top_10_spam=sorted_coef.head(10)
top_10_ham=sorted_coef.tail(10)
print('Spam:\n',top_10_spam,'\n')
print('Ham:\n',top_10_ham)
```

* **The results were the following:**

```jupyter

That concluded the hands-on task.
