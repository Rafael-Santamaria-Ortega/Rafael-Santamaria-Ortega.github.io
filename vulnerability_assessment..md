# Vulnerability Assessment for a fictional e-commerce | Vulnerability Assessments

In this hands-on activity from the `Google Cybersecurity Professional` I simulated being a new cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, that identified a critical vulnerability: the companyâ€™s remote database server, accessible to employees globally, has been publicly exposed since launch. Recognizing this as a significant security risk, I was tasked with conducting a vulnerability assessment to outline the potential threats this exposure poses to business operations, and recommending security measures to protect the server from unauthorized access.

The scenario was described as such:

"You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured."

The vulnerability assessment I produced is the following:
